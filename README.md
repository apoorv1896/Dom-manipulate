## https://apoorv1896.github.io/Dom-manipulate/


the project is about dom manipulation For this a heading element is there we have to manipulate that heading tag using DOM.

*first of all I had to create an h1 tag for the heading and this tag well well-manipulated.
*For manipulation we took a different property of CSS like the color of text, background color, padding, font size, and font Weight.
* As we click on different options in color etc. it will change in the heading tag.
* So I use a html CSS and javascript
* In Javascript:-
* I make a function of taken event listener and I get all the elements to init by using Doucumnet.getElementById.
* Then inside this function I had to make another separate function for all the elements.
* In that function I get the all values that we chose in option list.
* And then by using this it gets a value to a heading tag.
* And it gets manipulated according to our selection of options.
